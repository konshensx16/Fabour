A topic is the server side representation of a pubsub channel
  
  NOTES TO MYSELF:
    trying to get the number of clients connected to the channel
    ☐ Tried to get the number by INC++ the counter on each connect which didn't workm (always one 1)
    ☐ Might try to get the vale from the back-end, on each connect the back-end wil send us back the number of connected clients
    ☐ The number of connected clients is the number of subscriptions ?? ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT 
    ☐ Using events could be the better solution since it provides a onClientConnect method, but currenctly cannot get it to work because of this
      Cannot autowire service "gos_web_socket_server.client_event.listener": argument "$clientStorage" of method 
      ☐ Should probably debug the container and see if GOS has any services in there not nothing at all
        Client storage service is defined in the container i can see it in the debugger, not really sure what that error above actually indicates

         Well autowiring isn't enabled so that could be the source of the problemm trying to autowire it
    ☐ Everything seems to be working fine no errors so far though i haven't tested anything yet, one thing currenctly not working is the onServeStart method not being recognized as a callback
    ☐ One thing i noted is that the connectedClientsCounter only update after i restart the server, the websocket server
    ☐ http://socketo.me/docs/hello-world -> helpful for storing the connected clients in an splObjectStorage to send them messages later

  RPC:
    ✔ Maybe create an RPC that takes some sort of form (message form in my example) and send it to some_func and store stuff in the database @done (18-08-28 00:25)
      ✔ Create the RPC class @done (18-08-28 00:19)
      ✔ Register the RPC as service @done (18-08-28 00:22)
      ✔ Register the service with pub-sub Router @done (18-08-28 00:25)
      
    ☐ Create a custom RPC that does something that could be used in real life
      Take the message from the the message_form and store it in the databse using the RPC of course
      ✔ Create the database @done (18-08-28 23:56)
      ☐ Create the RPC
        ✔ Create the storeMessage function @done (18-08-29 00:16)
      ✔ Register the RPC as a service @done (18-08-29 00:18)
      ✔ Register the service with pub-sub Router @done (18-08-29 00:18)
      ☐ Serialize the from (not tested yet)
        ☐ Not really sure if i want to serialize it or something else
        ☐ The server side is still not getting anything, empty params
        ☐ Maybe handle the form like in symfony regularly (this didnt work)
      ☐ Maybe theres no way to send an entire form? gotta keep this idea in mind otherwise i might just keep searching for something that (might) not exist
      ☐ According to MDN, you can send a String, Blob, ArrayBuffer (me, an intelectual, trying to send a formData)
      ☐  Maybe i could use json to transmit objects (the form in this case)
      ✔ The last function that i included (serializes formToJSON) sends everything including the inputs, submit button, and the csrf token, might need to remove the submit button\ @done (10/14/2018, 11:28:35 AM)


    ☐ Create a separate example that uses the same messages type and see what the form returns in that case
      ☐ The request (ParameterBag) contains the same information as the formToJSON function returns 
      ☐ Need to inject the decoded params to the Message entity, not sure how to do it
      ☐ Usyally when doing ajax symfony takes care of the request since an HttpFoundation request is passed to the controller, in my case i'm only getting the inputs 
      ☐ Maybe i could use the symfony deserializer (trying this right now before moving to other solutions)
      ☐ Trying to get rid of the form[inputName] prefix, using the getBlockPrefix doesn't seem to be working for some strange reason 
      ☐ Right now i will try to give the inputs a hardcoded name, then if it works i'll continue looking for a solution to the prefix stuff
      ☐ What the fuck it's working now after wasting enormous hours ??????????? just using getBlockPrefix
      ☐ Maybe add more inputs (select, radio button, checkboxes etc...) and check wheter they work fine or not

CREATING A USER SPACE:
  ✔ Well nothing really to note here, just creating a basic user authentication system, maybe im gonna need to authorization too but nothing too fancy as of now @done (9/29/2018, 12:00:58 AM)
  ✔ And creating a a fixture for two dummy users for testing purposes @done (9/29/2018, 12:00:58 AM)

USER ACCESS:
  Basic example:
    - Users will join some sort of a room where they can chat together
        Let's say that we have two rooms, the users in room1 should only be able to post and recieve messages of room1,but not from other rooms (room2 & room3)
        Not sure if a conversation should have an id or not
    - Each user has a friend list and they can only chat with other users in his friends list


Websockets NOTES:
  ✔ I need a way to send the connected clients count when the user connects @done (9/29/2018, 2:23:13 PM)
    This works fine but i  must subscribe to a channel
    basically i need to update the connect clients counter whenever something happens
  ☐ Include the current user username when broadcasting a message (This is quite challenging)
  ☐ Need to use a PdoSessionHandler for user authentication and user sharing because Ratchet uses that, (might want to check the docs for more info)
  ☐ The current user is still being anon-xxxx when using the clientManipulator
  ☐ Display a messae when a user joins or leaves the chat
  ☐ Append incoming messages in the messagesList 
  ☐ Session on subscribe triggers with onPublish event

  ☐ Had to install redis-php to use it with the following command: pecl install redis
  ☐ Adding this to composer.json didnt do much: "ext-redis": "*"
    Maybe i need to add php-redis to php.ini (haven't tried this yet)
    NOTES:
      - So far i have php7.2-redis installed, also redis-server i think, and on the symfony level i have ext-redis installed ()
      - Switching to mysql just to see if it makes any difference (nothing gonna happen i guess)


      Jesus fucking christ the problem was when i try accessing it using the localhost it doesn't work but when i use the address 127.0.0.1 it does work 
        - More debugging coming later
  ☐ Way of sending a message to a certain user! I need to create a more rebust system where i can utilize this !
      ``` php
      $user1 = $this->clientManipulator->findByUsername($topic, 'user1');
        if (false !== $user1) {
            $topic->broadcast('message', array(), array($user1['connection']->WAMP->sessionId));
        }
      ```

MAKING A BLOG LIKE SYSTEM:
  ✔ Creating couple of entities: @done (10/2/2018, 10:06:11 PM)
    ✔ Creating the Post entity @done (10/2/2018, 10:06:12 PM)
      Post will have an author (User) and also will have comments (Comment)
      Might want to include the publishedAt just to make things more formal!
      Relationships: 
        Each Post has many Comments -> OneToMany()
        Many Comment Belongs to one Post -> ManyToOne()
        Each User has Many Comments
        Many Posts belong to one User (keeping it simple here, not doing any collaborative bullshit)
        Each User has many Posts up his ass 
        IMPORTANT NOTE:
          The property that has inversedBy will be the one that holds the foreign key on that Entity (table): e.g: post_id on the Comment entity
    ✔ Creating the Comment entity @done (10/2/2018, 10:06:13 PM)
    ✔ Might need to create some Voters for security reasons @done (10/2/2018, 10:06:14 PM)
    ✘ Not sure if i want to create a seperate controller for comment or just do everything inside the PostController @cancelled (10/2/2018, 10:06:19 PM)
          For now doing everyithng inside the PostController will change it later if needed

    ☐ Notify the user that someone commented on his post!
          - I think im gonna have to to create an RPC for this and not just a Topic
          ☐ Create the RPC to handle notifying the publihser of the comment # still need to write the logic to this
          ☐ Maybe handle the comment in the RPC too instead of the PostController # this might get canceled later, leaving it for now
          ☐ As of now i'm trying to send the notification to ther user using the controller! because that's where im saving the Comment in the DB.

          Just came across this in someones code 'dirtyseven' (a game made with goswebsocket), Broadcast a message from RPC to a Topic: 
            - Here's what i need to do!
              - Get the topicManager which a  thing that comes with ratchet in my RPC (CommentRPC)
              - Get the channel with the follwoing code: $topicManager->getTopic('chanel/name');
              - Then just broadcats on the topic that i just got!


WHA THE FUCK ARE THOSE SHIT NOTES:
  - Canot keep track of the notes im taking here :( 
  ✔ Install php-amqp @done (10/7/2018, 9:54:51 PM)
  ✔ Install composer require gos/react-amqp @done (10/7/2018, 11:15:02 PM)
  Couple of stull that i did (IMPORTANT): 
      Installed evenement/evenement 2.0.0
      Downgraded react/event-loop from 0.5.something to 0.4.0
      Installed gos/react-amqp

  ☐ Configure the amqp for the websocket 
      Couple of stuff i need to look up:
          The entire configuration file is confusing the only easy thing there is the host : 127.0.0.1
              Don't know what the port is supposed to be, for now i have just 8000 which seems to have froze everything as of now
                Maybe the port should be the same as the ratchet port (8080): This doesn't work either!
              Don't know what is the username and the password, (Probably the current user "logged in" credentials)
                  YES: i need a way to provide the values 
                  NO : what are those values then ?!?!
              Don't know what the vhost is for, current value is /
          Link to a document that might help: https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html
          
        Accesing the rabbitmq-panel:
          http://localhost:15672/
          Credentials:
            username: guest
            password: guest
        In the rabbitmq-panel i bound the gos_websocket_exchange to the gos_websocket (I think i know what i did here but i need further reading about this!)

        EVERYTHING IS WORKING RIGHT NOW!!!!:

        ✔ Send the notification only to the user that i want! (currently all subscribers get the notification) @done (10/8/2018, 10:44:32 PM)
            So i can get the connection from the topic (people subscribed to the topic) and from that i have to figure out which one of em the send the message to
            In my authentication system the username is unique so i can use that to fetch the user from the database without the need of an ID or anything 
              What im about to do seems a bit naive but will try it first and see if it's going to work (This does work)
        ✔ Visually display a notification for the user (UI and shit) @done (10/9/2018, 10:31:31 PM)

    ✔ Add the category dropdown @done (10/14/2018, 12:35:33 PM)
    ✘ CRAZY IDEA: create some sort of a draft system where the user work will be autosaved during the period he's working on it, and can always access it and continue working on it @cancelled (10/14/2018, 12:35:39 PM)
  ✔ Add the subcategory to each post, (Just doing what the last video in my channel was about) @done (10/21/2018, 1:20:17 AM)
    ✔ Load the subcategories dynamically using ajax (try plain javascript first, in case i decided to get rid jquery later) @done (10/21/2018, 1:20:14 AM)
    ✔ Create the relationship between the tables @done (10/20/2018, 9:10:38 PM)
  ✔ Change the fixture to use subCategories instead of category @done (10/18/2018, 9:32:32 PM)
  ✔ Update all the views to render the sub_category instead of the category @done (10/20/2018, 1:48:21 AM)
  ✔ Update the query to be based on the sub_category since the category was removed and you can only access it via the category itself @done (10/20/2018, 1:48:23 AM)
    ✔ Learn about inner joins lol @done (10/20/2018, 1:48:24 AM)
  IMPORVING:
    ✔ It takes 24 queries when loading the index page @done (18-11-24 20:59)
      NOTE: most of the queries are for categories so i should start there. 
    ✔ Make an infinite scrolling system for the index posts and also the bookmarks, and the user posts @done (18-11-27 19:43)
      ✔ Create the component and the vue stuff and add the script to the bottom of the index and all required pages @done (18-11-27 19:43)
        ✔ add script Index page @done (18-11-27 19:43)
        ✔ and the user posts page @done (18-11-27 19:43)
      ✔ Create the API that will fetch the posts @done (18-11-24 21:36)
        NOTE: the posts should be based on some value, in the index i don't need any parameter since all i want will be based on the current logged in user
        ✔ In the user posts i need the username which will be used as a parameter to fetch the correct posts @done (18-11-24 21:36)
        ✔ Make the parameter optional, if set then set to the parameter value, if not then set the value to the current logged in user @done (18-11-24 21:36)
      ✔ I will not be adding the posts to the store as of now because the pages will be refreshed either way which means the state will not be persisted @done (18-11-24 21:37)
      ✔ The design is a mess needs some fixing, (Check if the inline style causing the problem) @done (18-11-24 22:54)
      ✔ The created_at needs to be a string and should be set before sending the results @done (18-11-24 22:46)
        NOTE: right now i have two solutions, one is pretty basic and might be fast
          Solution1: When fetching the array in the controller::action, before sending the results i can loop throught the items and format the date there
          Solution2: i can use this custom class to add a new expression to the doctrine DQL, whihc will allow me to get rid of the loop in the controller::action, Link to the "module" and the article: https://medium.com/@narven/add-mysql-function-date-format-to-symfony-doctrine-dql-288ac51941c2
      ✔ handle the scroll event for the compoenent, to load more posts @done (18-11-25 16:40)
      ✔ Create the end point to get more posts @done (18-11-25 17:33)
        Note: i might have a rpoblem at this point, because when in the index page i don't need to pass anything but the offset, when viweing another user posts i need to pass the user's username, otherwise it's going to behave like the index.
  ☐ If we dont have anymore posts then just get rid of the event listener on the window@done
    I will postpone this till i do further research about this topic, and scrolling event in general since the console displays some warnings and points to some articles on the MDN 
  ✔ Change the editor to something that allows uploading images, @done (18-11-27 19:43)
    NOTE: try publishing on the medium platform for inspiration
    The medium editor: The first uploaded image is taking as a cover (thumbnail)  for the story, which the user can adjust however he likes, but it's a two step operation, first you publish the content, then another page asks you for the customization of the thumbnail.

  ✘ I might end up using the ORY EDITOR which as the docs says is on steroid but it looks cool, (It's only for react) @cancelled (18-11-27 19:43)
    @critical NOTE: there an extension for the medium editor that is not jquery dependent which i can use (branch: 3.0), will test and see if there's any problems with this
    ✔ Test the the extension above before moving on @done (18-11-27 19:43)
  ✔ Change the medium editor WITH TinyMCE @done (18-12-01 21:15)
  ✔ Create a separate file for posts stuff @done (18-12-01 00:20)
    ✔ @low this is just a work around, im gonna copy the files from node_modules to the assets folder, need to find a better solution @done (18-12-01 00:20)
      skins
      themes
      plugins
    ✔ @critical the plugins and themes for tinymce needs to rebuilt every time otherwise the hardcopy will not allow the watcher to rebuild the files @done (18-12-01 21:15)
      NOTES: 
        As of now the plugins are being required one by one in the post.js file, as for the css (skins), they're being built in the webpack.config.js file of symfony Encore
        I might want to change this stuff later to something better like dynamic imports of webpack, or do more research about require.context which allows copying directories, FOR NOW JUST USING THE SAME NAIVE APPROACH SO I CAN ADVANCE IN THIS AREA 
  ✔ Allow the user to upload images, either by dragging them or by browsing them @done (18-12-06 19:58)
    For this im gonna need to add couple of options to the tinyMCE editor, and also need to handle automatic_uploads which will hopefully allow me to upload the image as soon as the user selects the image.
    ✘ I need to handle the case where the user decides to remove that image @cancelled (18-12-06 19:00)
      This will be handled when decides to save the changes
    FILE PICKER DOC: https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/demo/file-picker/
  ✘ Change the desing of the post.create page to something similar to medium (minimal) @cancelled (18-12-06 19:58)
  ✔ Create the database for attachments @done (18-12-06 19:58)
    Schema: ID, filename, path (filename + path), created_at, title (caption)??, post_id, 
  ✔ Create the end point to handle the images upload. this should return the full path to the image as a response @done (18-12-06 19:58)
    NOTE: i will need to post id so i can persist to the Database
    Handler Example:  https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/advanced/php-upload-handler/
      The location key what specifies the location to the file
    For now just upload, handle the removale later

  ✔ Include a post data-attr in the html to retrieve the post id @done (18-12-06 19:58)

   ✘ @critical When uploading images for a new post, the post is not created yet which means the image will not have a post_id for the attachment table @cancelled (18-12-06 18:59)
     NOTE: at this point the post is alwasy created so i can continue working with the post id!
     What i can is when the user creates a new post (while writing the post), i can send a long a post_id which i can use as an html attribute, when the user publishes then it's fine, but when the user doesn;t refresh i should remove the post and not leave it there.
     ☐ WHY USING AN ATTACHMENT TABLE AT ALL.
       NOTE: since the attachment url is saved in the post content itself there's "no" need to save it in the attachments table 
       WHY? : having an attachments table allows me to remove the attachments quickly and efficiently from the server (uploads/attachments) because each post will have a post_id that it belongs to, 
   ✔ For removal my previous approach was incorrect, i only need to remove the attachments when the user removes the entire post, or when he updates and saves the the changes, then i just need to get rid of the removed photos. @done (18-12-08 12:49)
     Create a postListener to trigger when the content is updated, check using a regular expression for all chnages in images so i can use that value to remove the attachments
   ☐ @critical some images are not being uploaded, e.g: .png, .svg
   ✔ Viweing the drafts, when clicked should take you to the Edit action and the Display @done (18-12-10 18:08)
   ✔ Add the Imagine Library to allow the resize and optimization of images @done (18-12-14 20:30)
   ✔ If the user is the owner of a post that his currently viweing then display an edit button for him @done (18-12-09 12:45)
   ✔ Change the layout of the post display to be without a sidebar, put the side bar content somwhere on top @done (18-12-09 12:45)
   ✔ In categories only display published posts don't include drafts @done (18-12-14 20:31)
   ✔ Display a thumbnail for the post, as of now use the first img, later change this to allow the user to choose the image he wants. @done (18-12-09 14:55)  
     ✔ Index page @done (18-12-09 14:55)
     ✔ Profile page @done (18-12-09 14:54)
     ✔ Search results @done (18-12-09 14:54)
     ✔ Category pages @done (18-12-09 14:54)
     For the pages that are similar to index it would be BEST to reuse the same component Posts
   ✔ Handle removing the attachments when the user removes a post. @done (18-12-07 18:58)

   ✔ Allow the user to remove a post. @done (18-12-07 18:58)
     ✔ Create the action @done (18-12-07 18:58)
     ✔ Include the button somewhere in the fron-end @done (18-12-07 18:58)

   AUTOSAVE POST:
      ☐ Save using keys ctrl + s
         LINK: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16006583/capturing-ctrlz-key-combination-in-javascript
      ☐ Autosave using time Interval each 30 seconds or something
          This is not saving but it's displaying an message when you try to leave the page without persisting changes you made


     IDEAS: 
       maybe get rid of the borders around the inputs
       Make the body area much bigger (maybe the whole screen or something like that)
       Pull the category and sub category up next to the title (maybe both cat and sub cat on the same row, above the title )
       Move the publish button to the top of the list 
       Make the container fluid to use more space on the sides

   DRAFT SYSTEM:
      Creating a draft system so i can avoid some issue with post creation and whatsoever, this will help me with the attachments issue not the mention that people love having these drafts for future use, maybe a work in progress or something like medium and other dropbox paper
      ✔ Change the database schema to handle the state where the post is draft or a publication @done (18-12-03 19:58)
        This is defined by the published_at field
      ✔ Only show actual posts for other users (published ones) @done (18-12-03 19:57)
      ✔ For logged in user neeed to allow him to see his drafts in a separate page (maybe with entire posts doesn't really matter) @done (18-12-03 20:18)
      ✔ When editing an article or a draft if its a oublication just display an update button or save changes button, because it's already published, this code will be in the form event @done (18-12-04 18:13)
        I need to add a remove buttom somewhere in the same page, in case the user wants to get rid of the post!
      ✔ Move the logic of publishing a post (The notification stuff) from the create (since it's not doing anything at the moment but create the post and redirect), to the update action (when the user presses publish then notify the users of the new post) @done (18-12-05 20:29)
        ✔ First just move the code and make sure it still works! @done (18-12-04 18:36)
        ✔ Refactor the notification code into a separate service. to clear the controller! @done (18-12-05 20:12)
          THOUGHTS AND NOTES:
            Maybe i can create a service for creating the notification, this means create the notification object and Change 
              Create different function for Post notifications, Comment and also bookmark ? and just call them where needed 
            Put the function that returns the array of friends names in the UserManager service ? 
            Sending the notifcation can definitely be put somewhere else, in a service that does that
            ✔ Start by refactoring the comment code (EASY) @done (18-12-04 19:22)
            ✔ Refactor the bookmark code @done (18-12-05 19:42)
            ✔ Refactor the friendship code into the notificationManager @done (18-12-05 20:10)
        ✔ Refactor the post publishing code into a the notificationManager if possible @done (18-12-05 20:29)

      ✔ Remove all attachment when you remove the entire post @done (18-12-29 13:15)
      ✔ Make the images in the posts to be responsive @done (18-12-29 13:02)
         NOTE : this is currently fixed by adding a class to the content-wrapper (content-body) and all images now have a style similar to bootstrap's img-responsive
      ☐ Add an auto-save functionality that saves the user changes every 30 secs or something similar
      ☐ Need better error reposting for post publishing  
        For now just add a "Save draft" button to this, later add the aut-save stuff when everything is working.
      Database Schema:
         Post TABLE :
           Add another fields called published_at, if this value is set to a date then it means the post is a publication and the other users should be able to see it, if NULL then this is a draft and other users should not be able to see this.
      Note about the draft:
        The draft will not show up in the drafts is the user hasn't selected a category and saved the changes, it will just be somewhere in the system (Not accessible at all, so this needs to be fixed)
        ☐ @critical add a default value for the category upon creation

  
Categories:
  ✔ Maybe each category should have sub-categories ?? (Just a thought) (Just still from medium) @done (18-10-28 15:59)

  ✘ Create an action to generate four categories @cancelled (10/13/2018, 8:45:09 PM)
    No need for this since this is going to be static and never changing the during the entire web application life
  ✔ Create a separate page where the user can see all the categories and even sub-categories in case of adding them. @done (10/20/2018, 1:48:41 AM)
    ✔ Makes links to the category and a page where the user can see all categories @done (10/20/2018, 1:48:37 AM)
  ☐ Maybe let the user see each category by itself e.g: if the user clicks art he should only see art, currently im showing the parent category 
  IMPOROVMENTS:
    ☐ Fix the count of the queries being made to the DB
      NOTE: the category on the top are hardcoded the other categories are probably the ones of the posts
      ☐ Create a custom query to get the posts
        NOTE: currently it takes 8 - 12 msec for this to complete (without any changes)
      ☐ @critical do more research about few complicated queries vs multiple simple queries, 
        NOTES ABOUT THIS: in case of multple queries you take advatage of cashing which means the next time you require something it will provided from teh cache in matter of ms

    ✔ Friends (of the current logeed in user of course) @done (10/21/2018, 4:03:25 PM)
      ✔ Create an action (ProfileControler::profile) to render each profile (passing the profile as an argument) @done (10/21/2018, 4:03:25 PM)

Friends:
  ✔ The user cannot add himself as a friend @done (10/15/2018, 9:21:23 PM)
    ✔ In the UI don't display the button if the user is viewing his profile @done (10/15/2018, 9:21:23 PM)
    ✔ In the back-end check if the user is trying to add himself @done (10/15/2018, 9:21:22 PM)
  ✔ Users should be able to add each other to friend list @done (10/16/2018, 8:26:00 PM)
  ✔ Users can also chat with each other, might need to create a separate todo list for this since it's an entire system by itself @done (10/15/2018, 8:36:51 PM)
  ✔ The 'friends' table: will be called 'UserRelationship' @done (10/15/2018, 9:21:28 PM)
    Schema:
      RelatingUser -> User1 
      RelatedUser -> User2
      RelationType -> [friend, block, pending, etc..]
    Relationship(DB):
      Each user has multiple friends
      Multiple friendships belongs to one User

    How this will work:
        First the user will send a friendship request
        We'll add a row into the table with both users_id and set the type to 'pending'
        When the user accepts the request we'll update the type to friend
        If the users decides to reject the user request will just remove the row from the database

  ☐ In case of mutual friends i need to cme up with somwthing in the future, for now just get this up and running tonight 
  ✔ Add two records to the database with status of pending... () @done (10/15/2018, 10:01:00 PM)
  ✔ Only display the number of users that are friends @done (10/15/2018, 10:36:14 PM)
  ✔ Add a update_at field that indicates when the request was sent, or after accepting when was the request accepted (Friends since functionality) @done (10/15/2018, 10:36:15 PM)
  NOTE:
    I was doing it wrong, i should only add one record to the database when the request is pending, and add another record once the request approved 
    Why:
      Because when inserting two record while still pending, both users will get the notication of accepting the other user, 
      Only the user who get the request should be able to either accept or reject
  ✔ User shoud be able to accept pending requests @done (10/16/2018, 8:26:42 PM)
      ☐ Redirect to the user profile after approving the user request
  ☐ User shoud be able to reject a pending requests
  ✔ Users should be able to remove a user from his friends list @done (10/16/2018, 9:23:28 PM)
      ✔ Maybe from the user profile? when viewing a friends profile the user should get a remove from friends option! @done (10/16/2018, 9:23:30 PM)
        ✔ Send the information from the controller, maybe a boolean @done (10/16/2018, 9:23:32 PM)
  ✔ Display an indicator when the user have pending requests @done (10/17/2018, 8:05:51 PM)
      Might need to create an action to handle rendering everything related to the navbar (:, pending requests, messages)
    

Notifications:
  Probably the only thing that i'm going to struggle with, i need to come up with a good design
  ✔ Users should be able to get notifications about activity from other friends @done (10/24/2018, 7:19:07 PM)
  ✔ User should get a realtime notification about pending friendship requests @done (10/17/2018, 9:23:36 PM)
    ✔ Create the FriendshipTopic which will broadcast information to all users (friend request, approved requests) @done (10/17/2018, 9:23:34 PM)
      This could be used to increment the notification count in the title : http://roshiro.github.io/TitleNotifier.js/
  ✔ User should get a real-time notification when the other user accepts his pending request @done (10/20/2018, 1:53:26 AM)
  ✔ Friends should get notifications when another friend publishes something (maybe in the future add an options to disable this ? just a thought) @done (10/21/2018, 2:14:19 AM)
    ✔ Right now do the real-time stuff first before creating the back-end stuff (db and controller) @done (10/21/2018, 2:14:18 AM)
      Senario:
        Get the username of all friends in this uer friends list
        Use them to search for online users in the session
        Add those users to the list of eligible receivers of the notification
          ✔ Create a findFriendsById in the UserRelationship repository @done (10/21/2018, 2:14:16 AM)
  Storing notifications in the back-end (comments, publications, friends approval, bookmarks of publications, etc...):

      LINK : http://blog.osmosys.asia/2017/04/26/design-notification-system/
        NOTES ABOUT THE ABOVE BLOG POST:
          One confusing thing is the entity_type_id and entity_type which are stored in the notification_object table,
          The entity_id is a foreign key to the Entity that is being notified about, for example if it's a post , then the entity id will be a post_id,
          if it's a comment it will be the comment_id etc..., 
          entity_type_id is for identifying if it's either a Post, Comment, Bookmark etc...
          enityt_type_id should be defined ina  config file, it's not something that can be stored in the database (could be but it's just stupid ,
          i feel like it's better to do it in the server-side)

          Sending a notification about a new post:
            create a NotificationObject 
              INSERT the id, entity_type_id, post_id, status, createdAt
                ☐ Inserting just one row because the post is just one
            create a Notification change
              INSERT id, notification_object_id, actor_id, status
                ☐ Inserting just one record because the actor is just which is the person who published the post
            create a Notification
              INSERT id, notification_object_id, notifier_id, status
                ☐ This will contain a N of records depending on how many users we want to notify (e.g: 100 friends in a user list )
          
      Notification table:
        id -> int (primary key)
        notification -> string
        type -> string (comment, friend_approval, etc...)
        read -> true | false 
  ✔ Create a function in the repository to get all notification for a user! @done (10/24/2018, 7:19:17 PM)
  ✔ Create 5 different functions to get each notication with the required entity, (for Post get the post, for Comment get the comment associated) @done (10/23/2018, 8:06:48 AM)

          ✔ Display a link that takes to the post and scrolls down to the comment @done (10/24/2018, 6:28:47 AM)
        ✔ Display the bookmarks notifications @done (10/24/2018, 7:22:53 PM)
    ✔ Display the last 4 notifications for the user in the main navbar icon @done (10/24/2018, 8:54:05 PM)
        The desing of this list (slim design) doesn't seem to include scrolling through the notifications in there, so i might need to alter this later 
        ✔ First i need to create an action inside the NotificationController that renders the icon and fills the list (to separate things) @done (10/24/2018, 8:54:03 PM)
          ✔ Get the latest four notifications for the user @done (10/24/2018, 8:54:02 PM)

        ☐ Include the bookmarking to be sent via a notification too!
    ✔ Add the notification to the list after the user get's it @done (10/27/2018, 6:38:44 PM)
        Not sure if want to keep it always four elements and delete the last element in the list (probably what i'll do after i get this to work)
        ✔ Include the required data to construct a notification for the list @done (10/25/2018, 8:25:32 PM)
          I need the actor.username, action, created_at field (how much time ago), actor.avatar? , url
          no need to include the date because the notificaion will be sent at the very exact moment (date === now) which means it will always be o seconds ago or just now
          ✔ change the javascript to take the message instead of the entire payload (because the payload now contains fragments of the message and not just the message) @done (10/25/2018, 8:25:30 PM)
        ✔ Change the controller and javascript to handle the new post (publications) notification just like before @done (10/27/2018, 6:26:34 PM)

        ✔ Also for friend_approval @done (10/27/2018, 6:38:42 PM)
          ✔ Test the things above @done (10/27/2018, 6:38:43 PM)
    ✔ Create a single Topic to handle all notifications, in this case the notification action and everything will be constructed in the controller @done (10/27/2018, 6:26:39 PM)

    Grouping notifications:
      Grouping will obviously by entity_type_id which
      The problem i'm seeing is in grouping by same postm e.g: if three people comment on a specific post the notification should look like '3 people commnted on your post', this means i need to get the comments for the postm group themm and then send the notification? 
      ✔ Check the blog post for some ideas @done (18-11-11 00:26)
      PROBLEM: When trying to group comments for a certain post, there's no way to tell which post the comments were published on, because what i have as entity_id in case of comments is just the comment_id
      SOLUTION: I can access the post via the comment bu first i need to get the comment and then i can access the post_id 
      Currently i have a simple implentation for couting the amount of comments for each post which i can use to display a single notification instead of multiple (Check the NotificationObjectRepository::findCountCommentsForPost() for futher info).

      ☐ How to use inside the foreach loop (When fetching all different )? 
        So when accessing comments maybe i can use that one instead of fetting the comment by itself, POST_ID IS REQUIRED IN THIS CASE
        ✔ Getting comments for each post @done (18-11-13 07:26)
          ✔ The result is being repeated three times due to the parent foreach loop which will cause the repeating. @done (18-11-13 07:26)
          ✔ When trying to get the notifications.entity_type_id (grouped) i no longer have access to entity_id which is used in the 'post' notifications @done (18-11-13 07:26)
            NOTE: in this case im accessing each post by itself (multiple database hits)
          POSTS:
            A new apporoach for posts would be getting the entity_type_id and if there's a post_entity_type (1), then i can run a query to get the latest notifications 
            ✘ Create the query to get the latest notification (just 4) while grouping by the entity_id @cancelled (18-11-11 20:24)
              NOTE: it was already there that's why this is canceled
            ✔ Create the function to get the latest posts notifications @done (18-11-12 20:22)
            ✔ Include the notification id in all notifications to use to re order the list after manipulating it. @done (18-11-12 20:22)
            ✔ When displaying grouoed notifications there's no need for a username @done (18-11-11 20:49)
              Change the template to render the username only if given
            Fetching the results for the notifications:
               ✔ using a native sql since doctrine cannot use sub-queries in the form clause @done (18-11-12 20:22)
                 Native sql looks something like: 
                   'SELECT COUNT(n0_.entity_type_id)
                    AS sclr_0, n0_.entity_type_id AS entity_type_id_1 
                    FROM (SELECT * FROM notification_object LIMIT 4) n0_ 
                    INNER JOIN notification n1_ 
                    ON (n1_.notification_object_id = n0_.id) 
                    WHERE n1_.notifier_id = ? 
                    GROUP BY n0_.entity_type_id'
                    ✔ The order in the sub-query should be DESC @done (18-11-12 20:22)
              ✔ Disable sql_mode=only_full_group_by and remember that if you deploy this you have to re-disable it again otherwise you'll be ripping your hair off not knowing what the fuck is going on. @done (18-11-13 07:26)
                Command (IN CONSOLE): SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));


          BOOKMARKS:
            ☐ Change the bookmarks function to the same behavior as posts

          BUGS:
            ✔ Whatever case is first entered that's what will fill the enitre notifications. @done (18-11-13 18:19)
            ✔ The notifications are still not in order, everything is messy (in term of dates and order) @done (18-11-13 19:07)
            ✔ @critical make the limit dynamic when fetching posts, otherwise im gonna have a problem fo always fetchign a post even if there isn't any. @done (18-11-13 18:36)
              NOTE: what i did is very bad and just a temp solution, check the note above the function for info
            ☐ When grouping comments, the avatar shown is there is still incorrect, 
              e.g: ahmed posted a comment on admin's post, the avatar was admin's post
            ✔ The post url is messed up in the notification dropdown(of grouped comments) @done (18-11-13 19:11)

    READ & UNREAD STATUS:
      ☐ When the user checks a notification it should be marked as read (status = 1)
      ☐ I need a way to mark the status as read when the user clicks on it
        In both the dropdown and the full list
      ☐ I need to handle the click of 'Mark all as read'

    BUGS:
      ✔ When the user is not connected the broadcast (obviously) will fail, because the user is not in the session! @done (10/27/2018, 6:26:37 PM)
      ✔ The notifications in the (all) page are not being loaded properly ~ currently ordering them in the controller using usort (Mght change if any good alternative is found!) @done (10/27/2018, 11:13:29 PM)
          Steps to getting a list if all notifications (from my dropbox paper: Grouping notifications):
            ``` SQL
                SELECT n_o.id, n_o.entity_id, n_o.entity_type_id, n.notifier_id
                FROM notification_object no
                INNER JOIN notification n
                WHERE n.notifier_id = :user_id
                LIMIT 0, 10; // Limit {{after_row}}, {{number_of_records}} -> 1 - 10 records
                LIMIT 10, 10; // For records from 11 - 20
                LIMIT 20, 10, // For records from 21 - 30
            ```
            1 - get the list of all notifications, order the list by created_at field
            2 - Group the notifications by the entity_type_id so we hit the database as few times as we can
            3 - Use the entity_id to query the appropriate table and get the required result back
            4 - Re-order the list by using the notification_object_id 
    IDEAS:
      I might want to make some sort of a infinite scroll view for the entire notifications! (all notifications page wuith limit being just 20 notificaitons or 10 each time)
      ☐ change websocket to pattern of current logged in user
    TESTING QUEUES AND PERFOREMANCE:
      NOTE: this test will be done in the js file

            500: INGORED
            1,000: It was also fats like 3 seconds or something 
            10,000: 
        ✘ Okay so here's the mistake i was making, using the publish inside a loop will be limited in someway because the of the javascript, what i need some way to have like multiple computers do the same thing @cancelled (18-11-17 16:46)

     ✔ Play a sound when a new notification arrives @done (18-12-10 18:44)

    ✔ Need to display the latest bookmarked post first @done (10/21/2018, 4:55:59 PM)
  ✔ Add a created_at field to the bookmark so i can use to order the results, @done (10/21/2018, 4:55:50 PM)
    And also display to the user when he added that post to the bookmarks (users like to have control over everything :) )
  


Messaging:
    For now messaging will be between two friends, later on maybe add a way so that logged in (or all, depends) users can talk in categories 
    NOTE :Meaning each category would have some sort of a room will users can chat and discuss posts, ideas, opinions...
    LINK: http://www.vertabelo.com/blog/technical-articles/database-model-for-a-messaging-system
    Database Schema:
        Will only have one new table so far which is going to be the 'messages', which has the following schema
          ID: iteger
          message: nvarchar
          sender_id: integer (FK)
          reciepent_id: integer (FK)

          NOTE: i ended up waiting more time doing vuejs than regular js :) 
            The components:
             ✔ Left side which will contain the conversations (recent ones) @done (18-11-09 07:11)
               ✘ Probably a modal for writing a new message to someone (new conversations, which are not in the left side list) @cancelled (18-11-09 07:11)
               ✔ Display the conversations which were sent from the controller @done (18-11-09 07:11)
                 I need the fields: ID, (will be used to generate the URL), other user avatar (not mine), maybe the last message but this is fine for now.
                 ✔ The avatar values is not correct in the controller (Maybe something is wrong with the getOtherUser, or GetUserAvatar) @done (18-11-04 18:25)
             ✔ Right side which is the conversation it self (Focusing on this one for now) @done (18-11-04 19:10)
               ✔ Contains a message component which will represent a user message @done (18-11-04 19:10)
                 ✔ When i send a message it's a div with class 'media-body reverse' @done (18-11-04 19:10)
                 ✔ When i recieve a message it's a div with 'media-boy' as class @done (18-11-04 19:10)
                 Scenario:
                   When i send the message all i need to do is add it to the the list in the right column
                   When i recieve a message from the other user all i have to do is add the message to the list of messages
                   NOTE: when a user sends multiple messages without interruption the messages are all inside a single div called media
                         This means just one profile picture and the messages beside it.
                 PROBLEM:
                   I don't know how tell if the message is mine or not when recieving it
                     1- I can publish the message just to the other user and not me
                       This means when i publish i will add the mesage knowing it is mine
                       But means i have to add the message twice (In subscribe and also in publish "Not a big deal i think")
                     2- I can have a field or something in the back-end that indicates if the message is mine or not
                     3- In the component check if the name of the send is the same as mine, in that case i am the sender, if it matches the the recipient's name that im talking to then it is not mine it is his.
               ✔ Include the user avatar in the payload with the message @done (18-11-04 19:10)
               ✔ The message is being sent to both users, only send to the other user @done (18-11-04 19:10)
               ✘ Input to send the message (not sure if this needs to be a separate component) @cancelled (18-11-04 19:10)
                 ✔ Focus on the input when the component is mounted @done (18-11-15 17:53)
                 ✔ Both return key and the icon should send the message and also clear the input and focus back on it @done (18-11-04 19:10)
               NOTE: using vue-wamp for now since there isn't anything else on the web (didn't look much tbh)

        BACK-END:

        ✔ Create a listener which sets the created_at date @done (18-11-02 23:29)

          ✔ Thinking about each time a user connects i'll send him a list of the latest messages (Instead of creating a seprate end-point) @done (18-11-26 21:38)
          ✔ To send a message i will publish from the front-end @done (18-11-02 23:06)  
          ✔ Inside the topic i need to get several things @done (18-11-04 10:17)
            ✔ The message @done (18-11-02 23:29)
            ✔ The sender (just the current logeed in user) @done (18-11-02 23:29)
            ✔ The recipient (not sure how to get this one) (got it from the front-end and "queryied" the DB for the record) @done (18-11-03 19:29)
              1- I can try sending the recipient username when the user sends the message but that's kind of repetitive
              2- Since im using a path /conversation/{username}, maybe i can get the username and use it to fetch the user entity ?!
              3- Remove the project and play battlefield
              NOTE: when the user is in the session i can access the user which is an object of 'App\Entity\User', if not i will get null
                * This means if the user is connected then it is easy to get the recipient
                * The problem remains of the user is not online, i need to get the user somehow.
                  Solution: maybe just search in the list of users using the username 
                            Creating a function inside the MessageManager which recieves the username and search for the user and inserts it
        ✘ Currently setting the sender inside the MessageListener @cancelled (18-11-03 21:50)
          ✔ @critical getting the current logged in (aka the sender) gives me a User object that is not initialized yet! @done (18-11-03 21:46)
            Solutions :
              1- I tried to get just the username and then fetch from the databse for the record just like the recipient but this introduced a new problem, the list of records has random order which means i could easily mix the sender and recipient
              2- for now im just gonna get each record by itslef (two separate queries)
        ✔ Not sure if messages between users should be stored in the database or just like an IRC (they will be stored since i have a table now) @done (18-11-03 21:51)
        ✔ Create the pattern where the channel is going to be like conversation/{username} @done (18-11-04 10:30)
          NOTE: i had to serialize the object using twig (json_encode() only encodes public properties, so i had to explicitly call the get the values before encoding them, "Check the controller for more")
          ✔ Pass the user from the php to the component by using props @done (18-11-03 22:13)
            ✔ Include the user avatar in the object @done (18-11-15 18:13)
        ✔ For each message i need to send along the avatar ? @done (18-11-04 19:18)
          NOTE: maybe i can just get it once when the conversation is loading and use it then
          Q: But what about old message ?? 
          A: Maybe when fetching the messages i can also get the username and the avatar?
        ✔ Create the RPC or the topic (MessageTopic) @done (18-11-02 23:06)
        ✔ Learn more about patterns (patterns are deprecated and are now called paths) and take advantage of them in this case @done (18-11-04 10:29)
        ✔ Remove the recipient from the front-end and get it in the topic (where the recipient is the username in the route) @done (18-11-04 10:33)
          ✔ Remove from the vuejs part @done (18-11-04 10:33)
          ✔ Fetch the new value using the username attribute @done (18-11-04 10:33)
          NOTES on uasge of patterns:
            The first thing this is the exact syntax for this route to work, (GET RID OF THE __ WHEN COPYING)
            message_topic: ____
                channel: message/{username}
                handler: __
                    callback: 'message.topic'
                requirements: __
                    username: __
                        pattern: '\w+'
            TO set up a pattern include the name for part of the route that is going to be dynamic, then use that same value as a key in the requirements and setup a pattern for that, with pattern being any valid regex expression (inside single quotes)!
         NEW APPROACH:
            ✔ Create a conversation table with the folling schema @done (18-11-04 16:51)
            ID: integer
              user_1: FK (who started the conversation)
              user_2: FK (the other guy, recipient)
            ✔ Add the FK conversation_id to message @done (18-11-04 16:51)
            ✔ Create a conversation for testing purposes with admin and ahmed being the participants @done (18-11-04 19:16)
              Admin will be the first_user which means the one who created this conversation
            ✔ When a new message is persisted i need to include the conversation_id (Will do after i make sure this is working) @done (18-11-04 19:16)
              PROBLEM: I  need to display the other user avatar when displaying the conversations, how do i know if im the first or the second user
              Solution: maybe i can check if the user is me then ignore if it's the other user then get his avatar
              NOTE: This is gonna be the slowest thing ever!!
             
           ✔ I need a way so both users will be subscribed to the same channel (conversation_id) @done (18-11-04 19:16)
           ✔ The message is not being saved after publishing (just hads to restart the gos server) @done (18-11-04 19:18)

           ✔ When the user access the messages page, he should just get a welcome message and need to actually choose a conversation before communicating @done (18-11-04 21:33)
           ✔ Create a modal where the user can create a new conversation @done (18-11-09 06:41)
             This ended up just being an input and not a modal, since modal sounds just a lil bad, Check bottom of Messaging section
           ✔ The left side containing the conversations should display the latest message between two users! @done (18-11-05 06:47)
             Tired to do this in a single query but i couldn't, fo now getting the message in a separate query, maybe later i can join them together into one
             ✔ Also display how much time has been since the last message @done (18-11-05 06:47)

        BUGS:
          ✔ The relationship is not setup properly and causing some errors (User & Message Entities ) @done (18-11-03 19:32)
          ✔ The screen doesn't scroll down with messages @done (18-11-09 06:52)
          ✔ @critical The sender id is always admin in the database, (Check the MessageManager) @done (18-11-06 15:15)
            ✔ Okay some really fucked up shit just came up, the user is the same same in both sessions @done (18-11-06 15:15)
            explanation: 
              If i log in as "admin" in firefox, and log in as "ahmed" in chrome
              Who ever sends the first message will be the user logged in in the both session (both browsers)
              Which doesn't make any sense, so im guessing this has something to do with goswebsocket being trash!
              ✘ Try sending the current user from the pusher and not in the messageManager  @cancelled (18-11-05 19:32)
                GIVES THE SAME RESULT!
              ✘ Maybe i should set the user in a private property once he's connected! @cancelled (18-11-06 15:15)
                GIVES THE SAME RESULT, THIS IS WEIRD AS FUCK!
              ✔ @bad try send BOTH the sender and recipient in the publish object @done (18-11-06 15:15)
                ☐ Check if the user is not the same current logged in user
                @critical NOTE: i assume this will have just the same effect if i try to do anything else based on the current logged in user
            ✔ The users avatars are messed up and im consfused where to change this @done (18-11-06 15:24)
               Walkthorugh:
                 Check if the problem is in the controller
                 ✔ Dump the messages in the twig file and see if the correct values are there @done (18-11-06 15:20)
                   This is working fine 
                 ✔ Check the vue component for errors or mix ups @done (18-11-06 15:24)
           ✔ Not sure if this is should be called a bug lol, trim the length of the message if it's too long in the leftSide bar @done (18-11-09 07:11)
          ✔ When the other user is not connected i'll be getting the message back, which is bad (don't send to anyone if not online) @done (18-11-05 07:06)
    Creating new Conversations:
      1- This will be a modal that will popup and give the user the ability to choose from one of his friends nad the create a conversation between the users
      2- I Might want to display just an input for the username and whe the user starts searching it will fetch the username for the recipient user, once the user clicks that name a new conversation will be created and the users can start chatting
      * I am thinking this is the perfect case of using RPC
      * Also thinking about making the modal a seperate component
      NOTE: check the admin template if there's any modals already there!
      Front-end:
        ✔ Create the component that will be toggled with the compose message @done (18-11-06 16:16)
        ✘ Maybe i can use typeahead and bloodhount for autocomplete (Since im familiar with those) (Also check for other vue packages) @cancelled (18-11-09 06:21)
          Not sure how this information is going to get through
          * VIA AJAX -> This one seems better because im gonna save some time and only do this when the user request it.
          * Or should be sent via php when the page is rendering.
        ✔ Toggle the input by using the compose button @done (18-11-07 08:49)
        ✔ Create an event handler for typing @done (18-11-07 09:03)

        ✔ Initialize Typeahead @done (18-11-07 09:24)
          NOTE: only initialize this if bloodhoud succeds, if bllodhound fail, then what the hell are we event doing 
        ✔ Initialize Bloodhound @done (18-11-07 09:29)
        ✘ Get the values from the controller Via ajax (axios is already installed) @cancelled (18-11-07 23:05)
           I ended up not needing axios since the remote and prefetch options handle this for me :)
        ✔ Not sure if i want to use FosRoutingJs to generate URls or just use the data-attributes (html-attributes and save some time and bytes) @done (18-11-07 21:26)
          Using FosRoutingJS just in case i want to turn everything into vuejs and sheeeet
        NOTE ON BLOODHOUND AND TYPEAHEAD:
          Bloodhound provides a function called 'search' which searches the array for matching query
          Typeahead have a function that takes too arguments, 'query' & 'result'
          What i wanna do is use the typeahead query which basically means the user input and use it in the blooghound search function
          ✔ Trying the above before moving any further @done (18-11-08 20:31)
             I don't know what's written above just noting that i didn;t use the promise provided by bloodhound instead using the ttAdapter functin to get an array or someshit, which works
        ✘ Fix the typeahead styles and everything @cancelled (18-11-08 21:09)
        ✘ Render a custom template for each suggestion @cancelled (18-11-08 21:09)
        ✔ When clicking the conversation on the left side it's doesn't redirect to the correct URL @done (18-11-09 07:11)
          This only happends when im already seeing another conversation, the url becomes, '/con/con/5', it should be just'/con/5'
          I might Need to generate absolute URLs for this.
          ✔ Expose the url to js @done (18-11-09 07:11)
        Vuejs-Autocomplete:
        ✔ Replace Typeahead with vuejs-auto-complete, typeahead is being a bitch without jquery @done (18-11-08 22:23)

          ✔ Generate the URL to create a new conversation in the item @done (18-11-08 23:51)
            ✔ PRBLM: the item is clickable but doesn't take to the url, probably defaultBehaviour prevented @done (18-11-08 23:51)
              This is easily fixed by attaching a hanler to the @selected event, and do the redirecting there, this provides an object which contains a display (which is whatever is rendered as the item) and the selectedObject (which contains the properties or whatever you passed to the original item, in my case the username and the avatar)
        ✔ On the messages page (when greeted with a message, the left side isn't showing any avatars in the left side) @done (18-11-09 06:26)
      
      Back-End:

    Changes:
      ✘ Use the ScrollIntoView function to scroll down messages if possible instead of the current solution @cancelled (18-11-26 21:38)
        Which just takes the sceroll scroll height and add it to the scrollTop, works but i think could be better
      ✔ Maybe i should add a read_at field which indicates if the user read the message or not @done (18-11-18 13:26)
      ✔ Load just the latest 20 message for a conversation @done (18-11-18 13:26)
        ✔ Change the function from raking taking a collection to taking an array @done (18-11-18 13:26)
        ✔ Need to inner join the user so i can access the username and avatar when constructing the messages array @done (18-11-18 13:26)
      ✔ Add an indicator in case of unread messages when the user logs in @done (18-11-26 22:20)

    Mark messages as read & get the unread messages for conversations:
      Database changes:
        ✔ Add the read_at key which will have to value, either null || DateTime() @done (18-11-17 22:05)
      ✔ Create a function in the repository for a given conversation_id get the count of unread messages @done (18-11-17 23:01)
        ✔ This query is fast (about 7,3k messages in 0.01 sec) but i can make faster by doing the following @done (18-11-17 23:35)
          When querying for the unread messages i can check just the latest 20 messages and if there are more than 20 just display a 20+ icon :)) 
      ✔ Mark the conversation messages as read when viweing a conversation @done (18-11-18 12:34)
        NOTE: this should be done when the conversation is loading
        ✔ Theres a problem with this, the count will be displayed even though, they're marked as read, because the count is set before the read_at is set @done (18-11-17 23:48)
        ✔ @critical I need to change instead of updating using the message ID i need to use the conversation ID, because the queries being sent to the databse is incredibily high @done (18-11-18 12:34)
        ✔ @critical The approach im following is wrong, because when the messages are unread and i log in they gonna be marked as read, but when i sent them to someone else and i reopen the conversation, they will also be marked as read, and that's not how it's supposed to work, i need to only update mine. @done (18-11-18 12:34)
        ✔ @low When couting the unread messages it better to only count the ones the other user sent and not include mine, other wise im gonna get the same value as him even though im the one who sent those messages @done (18-11-18 12:34)
      ✔ Remove all the messages that has an ID > 100 to make the work faster @done (18-11-17 23:42)

    CHANGES FOR THE MESSING SYSTEM:
      The conversation should be loaded via an ajax request, because loading it each time is painful and slow
      ✔ Include Vuex to save the state of conversations in a store @done (18-11-20 19:53)
      ✔ Right now just making the request when the Left component loads @done (18-11-18 14:27)
      ✔ Load the right side messages using the same as before, axio @done (18-11-20 19:53)
      ✔ @critical the mark as read is taking a lot of time to execute @done (18-11-20 19:53)
      MORE TODOS AT THE BOTTON OF THE FILE
    LOADING PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHEN SCROLLING UP:
      FRONT-END:
        ✔ Add a scroll event to the window @done (18-11-20 21:57)
          when scrolling to the top, dispatch the action and get some old messages
        ✔ The window shouldn't scroll and should stay in the same spot @done (18-11-21 00:31)
          The problem is whenever the messages list updates, the window has to scroll down, i need to change this
          This a fucking pain in the ass because vue is behaving strangely and the computer too
          ✘ What in gods name is this shit, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, try refreshing to see this behaviour @cancelled (18-11-21 00:16)
          The window isn't scrolling anymore thanks to some math i stole from sombody
        ✔ Display a loading indicator @done (18-11-21 00:57)
        ✔ Make the offset dynamic somehow, and send it in the Url when making api call @done (18-11-21 00:57)
          Each conversation should have an offset, the offset will only be incremented when we ask for previous messages
          The offset by default will fetched from the server along with other conversations and will default to 20
        ✔ Make the conversation_id dynamic @done (18-11-21 00:57)
        ✔ When switching between conversations the offset will still be set to whatever previous value there was, what i need to do is instead of getting the conversations each time, just get them once, and each conversation should store the messages i got @done (18-11-21 14:36)
          Another solution would be instead of using an offset, i can just send the id of the first message to the list and use that id to get the messages prior to that one
          ✔ When fetching the messages instead of saving them to the messages array, store them in the conversation object @done (18-11-21 14:21)
            NOTE, maybe i should create a getter to get the enitre 'single' conversation
            i think it's working bu the order of operations is messed up that's why i dont see the result 
            ✔ One thing i can do to optimise this a little bit is to use the conversation id as the key for the array which means i can access the conversation by it's id which is fast: O(1) @done (18-11-21 14:36)
        ✔ When loading the conversation messages don't allow extra requests because they're useless at this point @done (18-11-21 20:11)
          NOTE: i mean when switching conversations dont relolad them for nothing
        ✔ When scrolling up i need a way to stop other wise the user will just continue to go up and break the system with an offset that doesn't exist @done (18-11-21 20:27)
          NOTE: i can use the total messages in a conversation and check if the current count is less than total count, if true then that means i can still get more messages, if not them that means i reached the end
          ✔ Currently getting the count by just using the count() function, assuming this makes an extra query to the DB for each conversation, i have to change this @done (18-11-21 19:51)
          ✔ When scrolling check if the count of current messages matches the total that i got @done (18-11-21 20:03)
          ✔ When sending a new message increase the total on the conversation @done (18-11-21 20:27)
            NOTE: i think this should be done in the ADD_MESSAEG in the store
        ✔ BUG: the conversation isn't scrolled down when opened @done (18-11-21 19:38)
      BACK-END:
        ✔ Load the previous messages of the conversation (create messaging api) @done (18-11-20 20:16)
          As of now the function should return the previous 20 messages, but i need to send some sort of parameter to get me the result each time
          ✘ Change the existing function to take an offset so i can re-use the same function and not create a new one @cancelled (18-11-20 20:01)
          ✔ Actually i should create a new function because the current functions name is quite specific to the use-case, and wouldn't matches the new functionality @done (18-11-20 20:16)

SOME ERROS FOR FUTURE CASES:
  ✔ Mysql wouldn't connect @done (18-11-14 18:30)
    ERROR: ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
    FIX: 
      Just restart the mysql servie and it should work, well it did work for me!

VUE & VUEX NOTES:
  LINK: https://medium.com/dailyjs/mastering-vuex-zero-to-hero-e0ca1f421d45
  THIS IS REQUIRED FOR SPOREAD OPERATOR USAGE: npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
  ✔ Creating a store @done (18-11-18 15:53)
  ✔ I have to inlcude the vue-router too @done (18-11-18 20:40)
    ✔ Make sure to include the router on the Vue instance @done (18-11-18 20:40)
  ✔ Render the conversations links using router-link @done (18-11-18 21:19)

  ✘ I might need to re-structure the components because as of now clicking the links doesn't give the required behaviour @cancelled (18-11-19 19:59)
    ✔ Didn't re-structure anything, just forced the component to re-create each time, to do that i need to add a key to the route-view like this: "router-view :key="$route.fullPath"" @done (18-11-19 20:01)
  ☐ Not sure about this, but i might want to store any fetched data inside the conversation array for future use so the user doens't make requests each time he changes the conversations
    At least for the user information, might consider adding the messages later too
  ✔ Load the rest of the data with an AJAX request @done (18-11-19 21:51)
    ✔ Load the user information @done (18-11-19 21:51)
    ✔ I need a way to access the other user id from the conversation @done (18-11-19 22:33)
      Change the url from "/con/conv_id" to "/con/:conv_id/:userId" which allows me to get the other guy's id to fetch the required info 
  ✔ When accessing the url "/con/id/id" i should just redirect to the messages index, other wise if the users refreshes the page it will just break with a 404 @done (18-11-20 00:32)
  ✔ The websocket isn't connecting on the MessagesRight.vue @done (18-11-20 00:32)
  ✔ I need access to the current logged in user inside the right component @done (18-11-20 01:08)
    ✔ Create an end-point to fetch the current logged in user! @done (18-11-20 01:08)
  ✔ When clicking a conversation that has unread messages, remove the unread counter after entering the conversation @done (18-11-20 01:21)
  ✔ Check how many requests are beign made each time the user changes the conversation! @done (18-11-20 12:01)
    ✔ NOTES: @done (18-11-20 12:01)
      ✔ The current user is only loaded once, which is what i want @done (18-11-20 11:59)
      ✔ The conversations is reloaded everytime, i guess this is how it's supposed to work in order to get the new messages @done (18-11-20 12:00)
      ✔ The user information is being reloaded too, this is fine as of now because the last_seen will be updated each time which is the correct behavior @done (18-11-20 12:00)
  ✔ Add whatever new message to the end of the conversation (replace the last message) @done (18-11-20 12:25)
    NOTE: right now the message is only being added when viewing the conversation
    I need to have some sort of a mechanism that allows me to add message and update counter, even when the conversation is not open
    ✔ This is tested and working under the above conditions, you must have the conversation that is going to recive the message open, otherwise it's not gonna do anything @done (18-11-20 12:27)
    ☐ I need to change this to whatever conversation is there to add the message to the list of the conversations.
      Q: i need the conversation_id
      A: maybe i can sent it in the payload and not get it from the route? 
      NOOOO this is not going to work the message will never arrive because the're two different channels the users are in
      ✔ I need to create a seperate channel for the conversations and all that, in which new messages will be added the counter will be updated along with the time, and also add any new conversations created by other users. @done (18-11-20 13:50)
        ✔ Already have a conversationTopic and im not even sure what id does at the moment, im gonna remove it and see what happens @done (18-11-20 12:51)
          Last time it was changed was 2 months ago, i guess was ony used as a test
        ✔ Each conversation channel will belong to a user ? @done (18-11-20 13:50)
          This means when another user publishes a message it should publish a message to this channel
          Meaning each user wil subscribe to his own conversations channel and other users will publish to that users channel 
          ✔ The code to this should be in the messagesLeft.vue component @done (18-11-20 13:50)
            NOTE: the payload shound contain the conversation_id and the message
          ✔ Increarse the counter of the channel for each new message @done (18-11-20 14:01)
          ✔ The counter is being incremented for me too, it should only increment for the recipient @done (18-11-20 14:13)
          ✔ Remove all debugging code or replace it with console log it's annoying as fuck @done (18-11-20 14:13)
          ☐ When viewing the conversation there's no need to inc the value, by edfault the user is looking at so it's not a "new" message
          ☐ Might want to play a sound for new messages 
          ☐ Create a nice hello message when no conversation is selected, similar to whatsapp

   Refactoring the file system:
      ✔ Make the file manager as decoupled as possible @done (18-12-02 14:44)
        Meaning : the current filemanager is spicific to the avatar directory, i need to make a general file manager which means i will be passing the uploading directory to the file in e.g: AvatarManager or AttachmentManager
        ✔  Get rid of the code from the profilecontroller and replace it with the AvatarManager @done (18-12-02 14:44)  
          ✔ problem:cannot create directory "" @done (18-12-02 14:44)

      ✔ Like the avatarManager cretae the AttachmentManager @done (18-12-02 14:58)
      ☐ Need to persist the attachment information to the databse
        Might need to include the 
      ☐ When removing the image i should remove it from the attachments folder too


Image optimisation:
   ✔ Require the imagine library @done (18-12-14 20:08)
   ✘ Create an event to handle the new file @cancelled (18-12-14 19:25)
   ✔ Create a separate service to optimize the image by just passing it the file?? @done (18-12-14 20:08)
   ☐ Dispatch the event right before uploading the file.
     NOTE: max_width <= 1058px 
COMMAND GENERATE ROUTES.JSON: 
makphp  bin/console fos:js-routing:dump --format=json --target=assets/js/routes.json



Create the registration page:
  ✔ Create the controller @done (18-12-31 21:41)
  ✔ Create the view @done (18-12-31 21:41)
  ✔ Create the Type and everything related to making it work @done (18-12-31 21:41)
  ✔ Log the user in after registration and redirect hom to the index (Not working) @done (18-12-31 23:51)
      Should probably redirect him the edit his profile but whatever this is easy and can be changed later, also nobody want to be bothered with that studff, he'll edit it when he wants to edit it 
  ☐ @medium i think theres a problem with the entiy since the doctrine:schema:update is failing with an error 


BUGS:    
    ✔ Users without any posts are not displaying the message, just empty space! @done (10/21/2018, 2:26:38 AM)
    ✔ In the post.display, when the logged in user is the publisher of the post don't display a add to friends button @done (10/21/2018, 2:24:32 AM)

    ☐ When viewing another user post, in the author profile section display a remove from friend (or just get rid of the button) if he's already in your friends list!
    ☐ Order of notifications when displaying them all is messed up (shpecially the bokmarks)
    ☐ In the notifications when a user approve your request, clicking the notifications takes you to your profile instead of the guys who approved your request!
    ☐ Admin one is friend with jasmine but when viweing her posts it still display "add as friend" button 
    ✔ When viewing search results, users and friends avatars are messed up because i didn't change them after handling the the user avatars! @done (18-10-29 20:17)
    ☐ In the messages page, the footer is not suppossed to be there, for now just hiding it in the layout file, but i need a real solution

   ✔ Create the session table using an entity so it can be migrated when DevOps"ing". @done (19-01-01 12:15)
     What the session entity should like, (Note the name is in plural unlike other tables and entities `sessions`)
      +---------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
      | Field         | Type             | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
      +---------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
      | sess_id       | varchar(128)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       | -> the name should be `sess_id` instead of just `id`
      | sess_data     | blob             | NO   |     | NULL    |       | -> this is done correctly 
      | sess_time     | int(10) unsigned | NO   |     | NULL    |       | -> not sure how to make a field unsigned for now its (int)
      | sess_lifetime | mediumint(9)     | NO   |     | NULL    |       | -> no `mediumint` in doctrine so i just used integer

      ✔ @critical guests can't see any posts -> js error related to the data-user-username attribute @done (19-01-02 19:17)
        NOTES:
            - The getPosts function uses the username to return the recent published posts
            - The username was never used which means i can just get rid of it 
            @critical DO MORE TESTS ON THIS AREA
      ✔ Only authenticated users can bookmark and edit posts @done (19-01-02 19:26)

        ✔ So when the user tries to access the profile/username he'll get the given user's profile, but when access just /profile he'll get his profile, which doesn't exist @done (19-01-04 11:41)
          ✘ Maybe separate the functions into two separate routes and deny the access to the other one @cancelled (19-01-04 11:41)
            NOTE: i don't like this because it means duplicating the view or using way too much of statments in the template
            Solution used: if the user is not signed in b and we dont have a username set to view the profile, then deny, but if the username is set even though we are not signed in then allow access to the profile
      ☐ @medium there a small flickering that says no posts when the posts are still loading, this ain't right

    ✔ Viweing a single sub category doesn't work at all @done (19-01-12 12:02)

    ☐ @high maybe i should use a date to fetch the other comments instead of id, because if somebody inserted a new comment while fetching data there's going to be some confusion or duplicate comments
      ☐ Use the last item date to get more comments 
    ✔ Create the vue component for the comments @done (19-01-20 12:34)
      ☐ @low Add a computed function to show just three first lines for very long comments!
      NOTE: dont forget to decode the response to json object (since it's a string)

 ✔ @critical There's some sort of a bug when bookmarking a post (that you published) @done (19-01-15 19:25)
   When displaying a post that I wrote i should only see how many people bookmarked my post, (Not be able to bookmark it)
 ✔ @critical i think notifications are in the wrong order, AGAIN !!!!!!!!! I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH THEM WHAT THE FUCK BRUH @done (19-01-16 19:27)
     NOTE: This seems to be in the right order right now, tried postign a comment, publishing and bookmarking 
     WRONG: what happends is types are being grouped, 
 ✔ @critical the user cannot post a comment, (Nothing is happening when submitting) @done (19-01-16 19:23)
 ☐ @critical pass the username instead of id when apporving a user friendship request 
 ✔ @critical edit profile isn't working for someweird reason @done (19-01-16 19:10)
   ERROR: Call to a member function getId() on null (goto: 76)
   Making the same mistake again, the /profile/edit (in this case /edit is being considered a username and my controller is trying to find a user in the db with the username "edit")
 ✔ Category route "all", when clicking on a sub category it redirects to the parent "big" category, which is the wrong behaviour @done (19-01-16 19:16)


Forgot password stuff:
  ✔ Create the action to display and generate the token (and sent it as well ) @done (19-03-23 01:41)
  ✔ create the route that will check if the token is valid @done (19-03-23 16:28)
  ✔ redirect to the page where the user enters his new pasword @done (19-03-23 16:28)
  ✔ remove the reset_password token and set a date for the new lastPasswordReset field @done (19-03-23 16:28)
  ☐ Add a notification saying that the user has changed his password
    ☐ This notification is not going to be real time, so i just need to persist it 
  ✔ Add a small header in the user profile that includes some security alerts (I want to make it dismissable) @done (19-03-23 20:59)



IDEAS:
  - Give the user (in profile settings) the ability to choose which fields to viewers
  - Maybe add replies to the comments section? 
  - @high Add user email verification to check whether the user is real or not!

Adding Tags to posts:
  ✔ Create the relationship between the posts and the tags table (ManyToMany) @done (19-08-08 15:35)
      Fields: ID, name, slug, (no timestamps)
  ✔ Create the data transformer @done (19-08-08 15:35)
    ☐ Check if the tags already exists or not, to avoid duplicates
    This should be applieds to the parent that is holding the newly created type, and not within the type itself.
  ✔ Create the custom type ?? Optional i think @done (19-08-08 15:36)
  ✔ Persist the code to SC with the title of "custom types" for future ease of search. @done (19-08-08 15:36)
  ✔ Add the pils design to the displayed tags @done (19-08-08 15:36)
    ✘ When removing a tag maybe make it editable (Youtube tags style) @cancelled (19-08-08 15:36)
  ✔ Display the tags when displaying the post @done (19-08-08 16:41)
  ✔ make tags clickable @done (19-08-08 16:41)
    ✔ Clicking a tag should get all posts tagged with the that tag @done (19-08-08 16:41)
    ✔ Create the controller with three methods @done (19-08-08 16:41)
      ✔ Show action => display every single tag that was ever created @done (19-08-08 16:41)
      ✔ Showtag action => display all posts for a certain tag @done (19-08-08 16:41)



Translation:
  ☐ Maybe add translation to the entire application, it should not be that tedious
